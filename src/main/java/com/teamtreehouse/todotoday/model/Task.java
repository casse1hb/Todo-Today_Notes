//associate each task in the database with a user.
// By using a user id column in the task table.
// map this to the user entity with a ManyToOne annotation, so
//I'm going to add that ManyToOne annotation here.
//And this is because many tasks can be associated to one user.
//And now Iâ€™d like to employ a simple approach to
//associating these two entities
//in the database and that is with a user id column
// in the task table. So let's use that join
// column annotation to configure that So
//right here all use the join column annotation and
//the name of that column is going to be user_id wonderful.
//And hey just so that JPA has access to both get and set the user when it needs
//to let's generate a getter and a setter for the user.
